Increasing number of the online music and video platforms started the age of recommendations. Nowadays users not only confine oneself to the content they know, they want to explore the content they may like. Here the recommendation systems step in to reduce the hassle. In this paper, some machine learning algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, collaborative filtering are tested on the reduced version of Million Song Dataset provided by the Kaggle Competition with the same name, which consists of the song history of 110,000 users. Original dataset provided by The Echo Nest, with additional data contributed by SecondHandSongs, musiXmatch, and Last.fm. Early evaluations show that the clustering algorithms are not applicable alone with such sparse datasets with high dimensions. To reduce sparsity of the dataset, PCA algorithm applied, feature number reduced to 16, and clustering algorithms are tested again. Further evaluations with clustering algorithms and collaborative filtering algorithm shows that although K-means algorithm may be used for such recommendation, in comparison with the performance of the collaborative filtering, it would not be reasonable.
